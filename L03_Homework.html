    <h1>the orchid flower, its meaning and symbolism</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Orchids are the largest family of blooming flowers with over 25,000 species and over 100,000 varieties. They are
        often grown as houseplants, or added to floral displays. But, not all orchids are tropical beauties. Wild
        orchids grow worldwide and can be found in every continent except <span class="Antartica">Antartica</span>.
        These flowers have earned
        the reputation as difficult to grow, probably due to their need for filtered light and high relative humidity.
        Many varieties, such as the moth orchid (<span class="Phalaenosis">Phalaenosis</span>) are suprisingl easy to
        grow as a houseplant.
